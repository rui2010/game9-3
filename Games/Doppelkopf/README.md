## Features

This game has been in development for a while and still isn't feature complete. While you'll get a pretty solid experience of the basic game, you will see that some things you might expect from a Doppelkopf game are still missing. Also, note that this game is strictly desinged to be a single player game. You won't be able to play against real humans with this game.

## Development
The game is implemented using Typescript and [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It's a small, frontend-only standalone web application that can be hosted anywhere you can host static websites. It's using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for building, bundling, and running the application locally.
