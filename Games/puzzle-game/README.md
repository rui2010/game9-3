# **Sliding Puzzle Game**

---

## **Description 📃**
Sliding Puzzle is a classic brain teaser game where the objective is to arrange a set of tiles or squares in a specific order by sliding them around a fixed grid. The game starts with the tiles in a scrambled state, and the player must rearrange them to match a target pattern or image.

## **Functionalities 🎮**
- Randomized initial tile configuration
- Sliding tiles by clicking or tapping on adjacent empty spaces
- Tracking the number of moves made by the player
- Ability to reset the game to the initial scrambled state
- Providing visual feedback on the progress towards the solved state

## **How to Play? 🕹️**
1. The game board consists of a grid of square tiles, with one tile missing to create an empty space.
2. The tiles are initially arranged in a scrambled order.
3. To move a tile, click or tap on the tile adjacent to the empty space. The selected tile will slide into the empty space.
4. Continue sliding the tiles around the grid until the tiles are arranged in the correct order or pattern.
5. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to match the target configuration as quickly as possible, using the fewest number of moves.
6. If you get stuck, you can reset the game to start over from the initial scrambled state.
