## **How to play?**
To play the Mastermind game, follow these steps:

1. You will be presented with a 3x3 grid, initially empty, and a set of target numbers.
2. Your task is to place the numbers 1 through 9 into the grid, one number per cell, in such a way that the calculations formed by the numbers in the grid equal the target numbers.
3. The calculations follow a specific order: addition and subtraction are performed from left to right, and multiplication and division are performed from left to right as well.
4. The calculations in parentheses are not considered, and you should work left to right, top to bottom.
5. To place a number in a cell, click on the desired cell and select a number from the available options.
6. You can change your choice for a cell at any time by clicking on it again and selecting a different number.
7. The puzzle is solved when all the target numbers are matched correctly with the calculations in the grid.
