## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**

- Each round begins with the rolling of five dice.
- The player can choose certain dice to hold their values during a reroll.
- After the three rolls (or after the first or second roll if you choose to stop) you must find a place among the thirteen boxes in the scorecard to put your score. 
- The score you get depends on the box that you choose and the combination that you have rolled. 
- If the criterion for the chosen category is not met, a score of zero is recorded for that category.
- After a box is used, you can't use it again, so you have to choose wisely. 
- The one with the higher score, at the end, wins.
