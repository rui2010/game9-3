<h1 align="center"> Connect4</h1>

## **Description üìÉ*
<p>Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. Each player uses pieces of a particular color (commonly black and red, or sometimes yellow and red), and the object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Because the board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the column.</p>

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**
<li>Players choose yellow or red discs. </li>
<li>They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs upwards, horizontally, or diagonally.</li>
<li>Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win.</li>
