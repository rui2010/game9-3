## **Description 📃**
- Memory Flip is a classic memory game where players have to match pairs of identical cards by flipping them over.

## **How to play? 🕹️**
- The game starts with all the cards face down on the board.
- Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs.
- If the cards match, the player keeps the pair and gets another turn.
- If the cards don't match, they are flipped back over, and the next player takes a turn.
-  The game continues until all the pairs have been found.
-  The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.
