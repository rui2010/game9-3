# Laser Darts

## Description:
The game allows the player to aim and throw darts at a dartboard to score points. The laser moves in a random direction and bounces off the edges of the dartboard. When the player clicks anywhere on the dartboard, the laser stops, the dart is thrown, and points are calculated based on where the dart lands. After scoring, the laser starts moving again.

## Functionality:
- The dartboard and laser are displayed in the center of the screen.
- The laser moves randomly and bounces off the edges of the dartboard.
- Clicking on the dartboard stops the laser, shhots the dart, and calculates the score.
