Hii!! This is a small single player solitaire game 
The goal of the single-player card game is to get rid of your cards and build the deck into a sequence and by suit from ace through king. The game is won when the whole deck of cards is built into the foundation. 
# What is Foundation?
The  piles of the sequence the player is trying to build from the tableau, beginning with the King. The aces will go at the bottom of the foundation.
# The scoring System!!
Though not all players are in it to earn the most possible points, there is a definitive scoring system in Solitaire.
