# **Stack Game**

## **Description üìÉ**
<!-- add your game description here  -->
- Objective: The goal of the Stack game is to stack blocks as high as possible by precisely placing them on top of each other.

- Falling Blocks: Blocks descend from the top of the screen one at a time. Players need to time their taps or clicks to drop the blocks onto the previous block. The blocks are usually rectangular in shape.

- Precise Placement: Players must aim to align each block directly on top of the previous block. If a block is not aligned correctly and overhangs the previous one, the overhanging portion is trimmed off, reducing the available surface area for the next block.

- Building Height: The goal is to stack blocks as high as possible without any overhanging portions. The higher the stack, the more points the player earns.

- Game Over: If a block is not placed correctly, causing the trimmed portion to fall off the stack, the game ends. The player's final score, which is based on the height of the stack, is displayed, and they can choose to play again.

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**
<!-- add the steps how to play games -->
- Starting the Game: Launch the Stack game on your device or web browser.

- Block Placement: As the game begins, a block will start descending from the top of the screen. Aim to align the block directly on top of the previous block by tapping or clicking on the screen. The more accurately you align the blocks, the more stable your stack will be.

- Building the Stack: Continue placing blocks on top of each other, aiming for precision and avoiding any overhanging portions. Each successfully placed block increases the height of your stack.

- Scoring: Your score increases with each successful block placement. Some variations of the game may also reward bonus points for perfectly aligned blocks or consecutive successful placements.

- Stack Stability: It's important to ensure that each block is stacked properly and aligned with the previous block. If you misplace a block and it overhangs the previous one, the overhanging portion will be trimmed off, making the stacking area smaller for subsequent blocks.

- Game Over: The game continues until you misplace a block to the point where the trimmed portion falls off the stack. This leads to instability, and the game ends. Your final score, which is based on the height of your stack, is displayed.

- Restarting the Game: After the game ends, you usually have the option to restart and play again to try and beat your previous score.
