# Trex_Run

<br>

## **Description 📃**

The game features a Tyrannosaurus rex (T-Rex) character, which is controlled by the player. The T-Rex starts running automatically from the left side of the screen, and the objective is to help it avoid obstacles and survive for as long as possible.
The primary obstacle in the game is cacti, which are placed at varying heights along the ground. The player must time their jumps to make the T-Rex jump over these cacti.

## **How to play? 🕹️**

The game's controls are straightforward and typically involve using the spacebar or up arrow key to make the T-Rex jump.
Timing is crucial to clear the obstacles successfully, as mistimed jumps or crouches will result in the T-Rex colliding with an obstacle and the game ending.
