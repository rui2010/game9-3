# Gobblet

## Description üìÉ
Gobblet is a strategic board game where players take 
turns placing their pieces on a 5x5 grid. Each player has 3 pieces 
of each four different sizes (that makes 12 pieces total), and the objective 
is to align five pieces of their color in a row either horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally. Pieces can be placed on top of smaller pieces, 
and if a larger piece is moved, the smaller piece underneath it becomes 
visible again.

## Functionalities üéÆ
- **Piece Placement**: Players can select a piece and place it on the board. Pieces can only be placed on empty cells or on top of smaller pieces.
- **Piece Movement**: Players can move their pieces already on the board to another cell.
- **Stacking**: Pieces can stack on top of each other. If the top piece is moved, the piece underneath becomes visible again.
- **Win Condition**: The game checks for a winning condition when five pieces of the same player align in a row.
- **Score Keeping**: The game keeps track of the score, awarding points for each win.
- **Restart Game**: Players can restart the game while keeping the current score.
- **Reset Score**: Players can reset the scores to zero.
