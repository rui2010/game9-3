  "She did not tell them to clean up their lives, or go and sin no more. She did not tell them they were the blessed of the earth, its inheriting meek, or its glory-bound pure. She told them that the only grace they could have is the grace they could imagine. That if they could not see it, they could not have it.",


  "If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible signâ€¦ to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very own skin.",

  "It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.",

  "When I was a kid, it seemed like they made something new every day. Some, gadget or idea, like every day was Christmas. But 6 billion people, just imagine that. And every last one of them trying to have it all. This world isn't so bad.",

  "Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.",

  "It's estimated that human beings only use 10% of their brain's capacity. Imagine if we could access 100%. Interesting things begin to happen. With all this knowledge, you could unlock secrets that go beyond out limiters. I'm not even sure that mankind is ready for it."
