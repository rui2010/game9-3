- Provide real-time conversion, updating the Morse Code output as the user types or modifies the input text.
- Ensure case insensitivity, allowing both uppercase and lowercase characters in the input text.
- Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid characters that cannot be translated into Morse Code.
