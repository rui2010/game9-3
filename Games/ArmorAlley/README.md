**Changelog / Revision History**
---

**V2.01.20230520: 10th Anniversary "Remastered" Edition Addendum**
---

Previous release: V2.0.20230501.

![Screenshot: Armor Alley, 2023 update, running in a full-screen browser tab. Game menu, Helicopter, battlefield and ground units are displayed.](image/app-images/armor-alley_game_image_1920x1080.webp)


## Bug fixes of note

* Don't let helicopter reach absolute edge of screen; buffer 5% on each side.

* Mobile / touchscreen: Bananas weren't firing sometimes, due to incorrect keyboard mappings.

* Sound: Always wait for sound load before firing `onplay()`.

* Sound: Relative, in terms of distance to the helicopter.

* Video: Ensure video is active when initial request / preload completes before playing.

* Editor: Engineers were being output as infantry.

* Update positioning of helicopter trailers for both sides, and when rotated.

* BnB: Show existing "Cornholio" turrets at start of game.

* "Midnight Oasis" network level: Added terrain decor - gravestones, trees etc.

## For developers

* Added developer notes, `gulp-cli`-based build via `npm`: [README_DEVEL.md](README_DEVEL.md).

* Concatenated + minified / bundled JS + CSS files, see [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js) for build script.

* SM2 + Snowstorm are now ES6 modules, included vs. concatenated into bundle.

---

**V2.0.20230501: 10th Anniversary "Remastered" Edition**
---
Previous release: V1.6.20220201. Original release: V1.0.20131031.

## New features

* **Mobile / touch screen support**. Updated UX / UI, better playability and feature parity vs. desktop. Portrait is playable, but landscape is preferable on smaller screens.

* **Network multiplayer**, like the original game. PvP, or co-op. Can be played with or against CPU players, as well.

* **22 game levels.** 10 original game "campaign" battles, plus 12 levels designed for network games.

* **Level editor**. Create or modify existing levels. Data stored in URL at present - terrible, I know. Also compatible with network games.

* Optional **"Virtual Stupidity"** theme pack. 🎸🤘


## Sound

• Even more sound effects.

• Some sounds can use ±5% playback speed for a little variety.

• Sounds can now be heard "in the distance," to the left and right.

• "Virtual Stupidity": 500+ meticulously-picked samples. 

## UX / UI
• "Live Graveyard" feature: decorate the battlefield over time. 

• "Remastered" 8-bit sprite assets from Armor Alley V1.1 for Macintosh. The original 1.0 and PC-DOS version had up to 4-bit colour.

• Nice home page logo, "scanned" from the combat handbook that came with the original boxed game.

• Network games use Windows 95's `LIGHTS.EXE` taskbar UI showing tx/rx traffic, very important.

• Four types of stormy weather: rain, hail, snow, and one other that's a surprise.

• Radar jamming: New visual noise overlay.

• "Extra-fancy" bunker explosions, particles, burning, and smoke effects.

• Nicer bomb explosion on ground. Hat tip: "Dirt Explosion" by SrGrafo on DeviantArt - https://www.deviantart.com/srgrafo/art/Dirt-Explosion-774442026

• "DOMFetti" confetti explosions, colours based on the target being hit.

• Notifications: Verbiage for different actions, e.g., "your tank steamrolled an infantry", or gunfire "popped a balloon" etc.

## Bug fixes

• Refactor of Traffic Control, so vehicles are less likely to get "stuck" waiting for one another.

• Helicopter bombs could be delayed after key press. They should now be consistent and fire on the next frame.

• Super Bunkers would sometimes stay yellow, even when friendly.

• Additional "arrow signs" on battlefield were missing from bases since 2013. Oops. ;)

• Parachute infantry (dropped from helicopter) no longer get a recycle (reaching end of battlefield) reward.

• Balloon respawning at top of screen: fixed.

• Allow balloons to be moving up or down at init, previously always downward.

• Fixed bomb spark / hidden / bottom-align logic.

• Tighten up inventory ordering / queueing, consistent spacing + avoiding overlapping between sprites.

## Gameplay

**Helicopters**

• Only the local player's helicopter blinks on the radar; all others are solid, as in the original game.

• Desktop: double-click no longer toggles helicopter auto-rotate feature.

**Smart Missiles**

• Notify user when trying to fire a smart missile, but no eligible targets nearby.

• Smart missiles can now take damage, and plow through up to four infantry (ground units only) before dying.

• Smart Missile targeting refactor. Removed former "missile facing target" requirement. Prefer shortest distance, unless just above ground. Hat tip: Pythagoras. :wink: :triangular_ruler:

• Smart Missiles now target your vertical offset, plus half your height.

• Smart Missiles now blink on launch, and take a moment (0.5 seconds) to arm themselves, and are not as dangerous (1 damage point) until then. This is implemented as the "Ramius frame count" (delay) 

• New feature: Smart Missile "decoy" ability, - about 1/3 of a second to see and retarget a newly-deployed parachute infantry when the initial target was the helicopter.

**Gunfire**

• Gunfire can now collide with gunfire.

• Turret gun firing rates have been reduced significantly for easy + hard levels.

• Gunfire can now ricochet off the roof of a Super Bunker.

• Desktop: Helicopter gunfire now stops when landing on, and cannot start while on a landing pad.

**Bombs**

• Bombs now "pass-thru" infantry, as opposed to dying 1:1.

• Bomb explosions on the ground can now take out larger groups of infantry.

• Bombs can be hit by gunfire in extreme mode.

**Tanks**

• Tanks have finally been given flamethrowsers (as in the original game,) which they use on infantry, engineers, super bunkers and end bunkers. 

• Game preferences refactor. Volume control, UX/UI, and optional gameplay features.

• Enemy tanks fire every 11 frames in "hard" mode, 12 in "easy" (and tutorial), and 10 in "extreme." Previously, all were 10.

• Tanks now repair more incrementally, larger gains every 1 second.

**Other**

• Engineers start repairing bunkers (if enabled) at the doorway, "shielded" by bunker vs. previously standing outside.

• Landing pads can be "The Danger Zone" if enabled in prefs. This was inspired by the 2022 Top Gun movie release. See also: "The Girl From Ipanema, "I Got You Babe," "Mucha Muchacha," and more.

• Base explosions can now also damage units passing by.

• Bases can fire rubber chickens + bananas if "match missile type" enabled in prefs.

• "GOURANGA!" - inspired by the original Grand Theft Auto.

• When the battle is over, the losing team's units all contribute to the explosion party.

## Technical

• Codebase migration to ES6 modules, patterns and syntax.

• SoundManager 2: hacked-together version of Web Audio API for playback, vs. HTML5. 

• Refactoring of game type and objects system; e.g., `tank` -> `TYPES.tank`, and `game.objects.tanks[]` -> `game.objects.tank[]` so look-ups and interating by type are logical.

• `game.objects.players` now has local, remote, cpu etc., which point to helicopters. Previously, many assumptions were made about `game.objects.helicopters[0]` and `[1]`.

• Network feature uses [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) (MIT license) for peer-to-peer communication via WebRTC.

## Miscellaneous

• It turns out there are _three_ types of cloud sprites in the original game, not two. 

• 12 smoke frames in the original game too, vs. my 9. 

• Nicer ASCII block-character logo.

• Updated favicon + related app / tile images.

**V1.6.20220101: Massive update for 2022, based on work from 2020 + 2021**

![Armor Alley: Home Screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/174437/148264540-d92c7440-8170-4413-b143-e113717ead8f.png)

![Armor Alley: Gameplay. A tank has just been taken out by the mid-level landing pad.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/174437/148266111-7ca11fe3-a3ea-46d7-8e7c-5a70c98ed00b.jpg)

**Video overview**

 * Demo, features and walk-through of "extreme" mode (55 minutes): https://youtu.be/9BQ62c7u2JM 

**Performance improvements**

 • The game should be smoother, targeting 30FPS. It is OK full-screen @ 1080p and windowed @ 4K in Chrome on a 2018 Mac Mini, 3.2 GHz 6-core i7 w/Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB.

 • More GPU-accelerated rendering, reduced DOM nodes by removing when off-screen (e.g., static terrain items)

 • All sprites should be on the GPU and moved using transforms, reducing paint operations

 • All transforms (CSS + JS) for positioning + animation are 3d, with the goal of GPU acceleration - e.g., translate3d(), rotate3d(), scale3d()

 • DOM nodes are not appended at object create time - now deferred until the object is on-screen for the first time.

 • All "sub-sprites" should now be GPU-accelerated via CSS animations, transforms and transitions

 • Sound: Only create `Audio()` when actively playing sounds, and destroy when they finish playing. Browsers are starting to limit the number of `Audio()` instances.

 • Sound: Queue and play sounds all at once with each animation frame callback, vs. prior ad-hoc behaviour.

 • Refactored game tip scroller to only show two nodes at a time, 1024px width vs. 102,400px. Front-end tech / Chrome Dev Tools demo:

 • Performance: Don't update known static radar items: turret, base, bunkers (bunker, end bunker, super bunker) unless marked as "stale" during resize / world scaling

 • Performance: CSS / `contentVisibility` to reduce / optimize rendering costs

 • Animation loop: improved timing, target 30 fps. Request next frame right away. Exit early if next frame arrives too quickly.

 • Turret "scan" is now a CSS animation; previously, animated via JS.

 • Smart missiles and helicopter trailers are now GPU-accelerated.

 • Performance: Battlefield and radar units are now positioned via transform: translate3d() - no more legacy CSS shenanigans using `bottom: 0px`.

 • Memory leak fixes: DOM nodes, audio events, and a few others.

**Sound**

 • Over 100 sound assets now in use

 • New and updated sound effects: Infantry and engineer gunfire, injury and death, credit +/-, helicopter and turret guns, shell casings on turrets,
bullets hitting the ground, turret being disabled and enabled (restored.)

**UX / UI**

 • Proper "game options" modal with radio buttons and checkboxes for various UX/UI and gameplay features

 • "It was a dark and stormy night" - option for snow on the battlefield. (May be slow on some computers.)

 • Bunkers, balloons and super-bunkers now use graphics from the Macintosh (68K) version of Armor Alley; a bit more orange, and less garish yellow.

 • Dune ][-style credit / debit UI and sounds

 • Toast-style game notifications

 • Health status bars when units are being hit or repaired

 • New and improved smoke / particle effects, more explosions and shrapnel, more fun!

 • Order queue: Refactored UI to show letters (e.g., MTVIE), with superscript numbers as appropriate.

 • Missiles smoke more, and in extreme mode, have a burst of thrust (as in the original game) as they near expiry

 • Pseudo-3D effect on shrapnel: Increase size slightly with vertical position on screen

 • Ground units are "behind" most terrain elements like trees, bushes etc.

**Bug fixes**

 • Bombing floating balloons no longer causes an explosion on the ground

 • Improved bomb and shrapnel alignment / collision positioning with balloons, tanks, bunkers, and super-bunkers

 • Fixed bug with quickly-respawning balloons (shooting balloon while infantry are passing under bunker, for example.)

 • Fixed UI bug where the "incoming missile" white line would not always disappear.

 • Game end: Improve alignment of view and base

 • Adjusted initial position of game, centering view on the helicopter + base

 • Helicopter / super-bunker: Improve vertical alignment if helicopter crashes on superbunker "roof."

 • Fixed radar item for Super Bunkers, now shows correct friendly / enemy status.

 • Cloud "wind" accelerates / decelerates more smoothly

 • Clouds no longer "bounce" when they drift off the end of the world, but get a nice bit of wind to bring them back into view.

 • Slight vertical alignment tweaks on gunfire and balloons in radar view.

 • Improved orientation of heat-seeking smart missiles (and rubber chickens and bananas) as they track their target

 • Tweaked movement and velocity of smart missiles, making them potentially faster / more random

 • Enemy helicopter will now turn to face targets. Sometimes it would fire the other way. ;)

 • Improved helicopter motion when approaching landing pad - "bounce" has largely been eliminated.

 • Improved off-screen / on-screen DOM pruning, restoration of 3D transforms when re-appending DOM elements

 • Fixed end-game bug, sometimes ground units (e.g. van) did not appear at base when blowing up.

 • Adjusted collision detection: if helicopter is hiding "in" a friendly super-bunker, bombs should hit the roof of the super bunker and not the helicopter.

**Gameplay**

 • New weapon: Heat-seeking bananas

 • Ground unit "Traffic Control" option: Vehicles try to leave space between, and avoid overlapping each other. Tanks will now "park" behind friendly tanks, avoiding a pile-up. Tanks normally only stop to fire. Vans and missile launchers will now wait for each other, too. Tanks will not stop for vans or missile launchers, giving tanks a greater chance of ending up at the front of a convoy - a preferable offensive position.

 • Units can now be "recycled" if they cross the battlefield, you are rewarded 2x cost in credits

 • Engineers can now steal all funds from enemy bunker

 • Engineers can now repair (but not rebuid) friendly bunkers

 • Bullets now ricochet off non-friendly super-bunkers

 • Shrapnel will ricochet off certain units (tank, super-bunker)

 • "Incoming missile" doesn't show in extreme mode when the radar is jammed.

 • End base, extreme mode: if a defense missile is destroyed, respawn another within 0.5 seconds.

 • Missile launchers trigger when closer to the helicopter, more likely now to be on-screen

 • Helicopter respawn: Delay if certain ground units are obstructing the landing pad.

 • Enemy helicopter AI: Default 10% of dropping bombs when targeting a tank, subject to game difficulty (hard: 15%, extreme: 25%.)

 • Bombs can now collide with smart missiles and take them out

 • Tank gunfire only hits bunkers if tanks are shooting at a helicopter, or another tank (bug fix: previously, tanks could destroy a bunker trying to hit an infantry on the other side.)

 • Super bunkers that are un-manned are "neutral" and dangerous to both sides, and will be shown as hostile on the radar. (This includes when tanks disarm a bunker by firing at it.)

 • Bomb trajectory now includes the helicopter's Y-axis velocity, and they now rotate along with their trajectory.

 • Helicopters now rise up from the landing pad on game start and respawn, like the original game.

 • Helicopter gunfire takes tilt / angle into account.

 • Helicopter "shake" starts when health is under 70%, gets worse with damage. This affects gunfire trajectory.

 • Your missile launchers only fire at the enemy helicopter when the convoy is "unassisted", e.g., there is no friendly helicopter or turret nearby.

 • Extreme mode: If you shoot down the enemy base's smart missiles while near the base, it will launch new ones that are faster and more difficult to dodge.

 • While on a landing pad, your gunfire may go over infantry's heads most of the time.

 • Don't assume the top of the battlefield is always safe; watch out for balloons!

 • Parachute infantry now fall at slightly different rates, and may be affected more by wind

 • A few additional, inspirational [ game paused in background ] messages

**Technical notes: development / code**

 • Migrated core JavaScript to ES6 syntax, retaining functional + prototypal inheritance style. Slightly less verbose.

 • As part of ES6 migration, dropped legacy IE 8 + 9 code and checks: ancient event handlers, lack of transform, `requestAnimationFrame()` polyfill etc.

 • Lots of cleanup: Exit early, reduced `if/else` nesting. Dropped all `setTimeout()` calls, moved to a frame-based approach: `setFrameTimeout()`.

 • `aa.js` (core game code) is massive at ~450 KB, and seems like a good candidate to be broken up into ES6 modules. TBD.
