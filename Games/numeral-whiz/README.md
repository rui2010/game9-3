<h2>Description</h2>
Numeral Whiz is an exciting and challenging memory game that will put your memory skills to the test. In this fast-paced game, you'll be shown a sequence of random digits for a short period. Your task is to remember the digits and quickly input them in the correct order once they disappear.
The game starts with a one-digit sequence, and as you successfully recall the numbers, the complexity increases with each round. For every correct sequence, your score will increase, and the number of digits in the sequence will grow, making the game progressively more challenging.
