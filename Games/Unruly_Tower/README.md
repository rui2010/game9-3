## **Description 📃**
- An addictive single player vintage game, which was inspired by a bunch of SNES/Mega Drive/Genesis games. 
- Levels similar to this was pretty common in platformers from that era to mix up the gameplay from the usual horizontal scrolling. Good luck! :)

## **functionalities 🎮**
- This game is not about any complex functionalities, but in general just a game focuses on incorporating game logics with JavaScript
- This perfect for any beginner
