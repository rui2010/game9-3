# Crossy Road

##  Description
"Crossy Road" is a endless arcade game that challenges players to guide a character safely across a busy road filled with various obstacles, such as moving vehicles and water bodies, while aiming to achieve the highest possible score.

## Basic Logic
1. Character Movement: The player controls the character's movement using buttons (or keys). Common movements include moving forward, backward, left, and right.
2. Lane-Based Movement: The road is divided into lanes, each containing various obstacles such as vehicles (cars, trucks). The character can only move along these lanes.
3. Obstacle Patterns: Vehicles move horizontally within their respective lanes at varying speeds.
4. Timed Movements: Obstacles move according to a timed pattern. For example, vehicles move at a certain speed.
Obstacle Interaction: If the character collides with a vehicle the game ends. The player's score is displayed, and they can choose to restart the game.

## Points
1. Objective: The main objective is to navigate the character across the road and other obstacles without getting hit by vehicles or falling into water.
2. Scoring: Players earn points for each successful move they make(Scores one point for each step forward). The farther the character goes, the higher the score.
3. Endless Runner: The game has an "endless runner" format, meaning there is no fixed endpoint. The goal is to survive and score as much as possible before getting hit.
