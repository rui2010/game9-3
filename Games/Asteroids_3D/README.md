## **Description üìÉ**
<!-- add your game description here  -->
- A JavaScript game that implements a 3D software renderer for rendering asteroids. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that can move and shoot bullets.

## **Functionalities üéÆ**
<!-- add functionalities over here -->
- **3D Rendering**: The code includes functionalities to render 3D meshes composed of polygons. It provides methods to create and manipulate mesh objects, apply transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling, and render the polygons on a canvas using the provided 3D software rendering techniques.
- **Player Control**: The game allows the player to control a spaceship represented by the Player class. The player can move the spaceship using keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D) or mouse movements. The spaceship is rendered as a 3D pyramid geometry and can shoot bullets when the player clicks the mouse.
- **Explosion Effects**: The code includes an Explosion class that creates explosion effects when an asteroid is destroyed. It renders expanding sphere geometries with fading colors to simulate the explosion.
- **Asteroid Generation**: The code includes functions to generate asteroids in the game. It creates instances of the Asteroid class, which are rendered as 3D sphere geometries with random sizes and positions. These asteroids can move in the game space, collide with other objects, and explode into smaller pieces.

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**
<!-- add the steps how to play games -->
- Move the mouse: The player's spaceship follows the movement of the mouse. Move the mouse to control the direction of the spaceship.
- Shoot: Click the mouse button to shoot bullets from the spaceship. The bullets will destroy asteroids on collision.
- Destroy asteroids: Shoot bullets at the asteroids to destroy them. When an asteroid is hit by a bullet, it will break into smaller pieces. Keep shooting and destroying asteroids to earn points.
- Enjoy the experience: The game features a 3D software renderer that provides an immersive visual experience. Explore the game environment, dodge asteroids, and test your shooting skills.
