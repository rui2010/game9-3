Reversi, also known as Othello, is a strategy board game for two players. The objective of the game is to have the majority of your colored discs (either black or white) on the board at the end of the game.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play Reversi/Othello:

1. **Board Setup**: The game starts with an 8x8 board. Each player starts with two discs of their color, placed in the center of the board diagonally to each other, forming an "X" pattern.

2. **Turn Alternation**: The game alternates between the two players. The player with the black discs typically goes first.

3. **Valid Moves**: A move is valid if a player places their disc in a position that "outflanks" one or more of their opponent's discs. An outflanked disc is one that is sandwiched between the player's disc and another of their discs. The player must place their disc in a position that captures at least one of the opponent's discs.

4. **Placing Discs**: To place a disc, a player chooses an empty square on the board that allows them to outflank at least one of their opponent's discs. The player then places their disc on that square, with their color facing up. After placing the disc, all the opponent's discs that are outflanked in any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction are flipped to the player's color.

5. **Skip Turn**: If a player cannot make a valid move, their turn is skipped, and the other player continues playing until they cannot make a valid move either.

6. **End of the Game**: The game ends when neither player can make a valid move. This typically happens when the board is full or no more empty squares allow for valid moves. The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins the game. If both players have an equal number of discs, the game is a tie.

7. **Strategy**: Reversi/Othello is a game of strategy. The key to success is to create positions that allow you to outflank your opponent's discs and claim the majority of the board. It's important to think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves to gain an advantage.
Remember, this is just a basic guide to get you started. The game has many strategic nuances and variations. Exploring different strategies and playing against experienced opponents will help you improve your skills. Enjoy playing Reversi/Othello!
