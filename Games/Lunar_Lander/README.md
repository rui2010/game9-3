## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to successfully land the lunar module on the moon's surface. The player must control the descent rate and angle to avoid crashing. The game is won when the module lands safely within designated landing zones, marked on the surface.

### Key Points

- **Fuel Management**: The module has a limited amount of fuel. Use it wisely to control your descent.
- **Landing Speed**: The module must land with a vertical speed below a certain threshold to avoid crashing.
- **Landing Zones**: Safe landing zones are marked and provide bonuses for landing accuracy.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**:
  - **Up**: Fire thrusters to slow descent.
  - **Left/Right**: Tilt the module to control horizontal movement.
- **Spacebar**: Activate main thruster for a powerful, fuel-consuming burst.
- **P**: Pause the game.
- **R**: Restart the game.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Simulates lunar gravity and module thruster mechanics.
- **Fuel Management**: Limited fuel adds a layer of strategy to the game.
- **Multiple Levels**: Increasing difficulty with various landing zone configurations.
- **Scoring System**: Points awarded for landing accuracy, fuel efficiency, and speed.
