            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards within the allotted time.</p>
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong>
                    <p>When the game starts, all the cards will be placed face down on the game board. You will see the score and timer at the top of the game area.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Flipping Cards:</strong>
                    <p>Click on any card to flip it over and reveal the image on the front. Click on a second card to flip it over as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Matching Pairs:</strong>
                    <p>If the images on the two flipped cards match, they will remain face up, indicating a successful match. If the images do not match, both cards will be flipped back face down after a short delay.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong>
                    <p>Each successful match will add 10 points to your score. The score is displayed at the top of the game area.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Timer:</strong>
                    <p>You have a limited amount of time (60 seconds) to match all the pairs. The timer is displayed at the top of the game area. The game ends when the timer runs out or when all pairs have been matched.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hints:</strong>
                    <p>You can ask the chatbot for hints if you are having trouble finding pairs. To ask for a hint, type "hint" in the chat input box and press the send button. The chatbot will suggest which cards to flip.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong>
                    <p>The game is won when all pairs of cards have been matched before the timer runs out. A message will appear congratulating you on your win.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Losing the Game:</strong>
                    <p>If the timer runs out before you have matched all the pairs, the game is over, and a message will appear informing you that the time is up.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Restarting the Game:</strong>
                    <p>Refresh the page to start a new game.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
