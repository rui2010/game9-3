##Flappy_Birdd Game ##

Game Description

Flappy Bird is a simple, yet highly addictive side-scrolling game. The player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground. Points are scored based on the number of pipes the bird successfully passes.

Game Elements

Bird: The main character controlled by the player.
Pipes: Obstacles that the bird must navigate through.
Ground: The surface at the bottom of the screen which, if collided with, ends the game.
Background: A simple static or slowly scrolling background to create a sense of movement.

Game Logic

The game can be broken down into several key components and steps:

Initialization:

Set up the game window.
Load images and sounds.
Initialize variables for the bird’s position, velocity, and the positions of pipes.

Game Loop:

Update the bird’s position based on gravity and user input.
Move pipes towards the bird and check for collisions.
Update the score when the bird passes through pipes.
Redraw the game window with updated positions and check for game over conditions.
Game Over:

Display the score and possibly a game over screen.
Reset the game state for a new game if the player chooses to restart.
