<!-- add the steps how to play games -->
To play Solitaire-up, start by dealing out a tableau of cards, face-down, in seven columns, with the first column containing one card, the second column containing two cards, and so on. Flip the top card of each column face-up. The goal is to build foundation piles in ascending order, starting with the Ace and ending with the King, separated by suit. Move cards around by creating descending sequences of alternating colors within the tableau. Empty tableau spaces can be filled with a King or any descending sequence. Utilize the stock pile to draw new cards when needed, aiming to strategically arrange all cards into foundation piles to win the game.
