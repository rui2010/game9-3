Welcome to Jar, a once peaceful land, now plauged by the evil fire creatures of the 13th realm.

As the 13th Knight of Jar it is your sacred duty to defend the lands of Jar from the invading hoards, banishing the evil creatures back to their fiery realm with your blessed spear.

But, be warned the presence of these creatures can burn the souls of even the most righteous of men.
