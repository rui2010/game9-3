## **Description 📃**
The challenge is to find a sequence of moves to rearrange the 'start state' into the 'goal state' in as few moves as possible. This game lets you play with these puzzles and it solves them in an optimal number of moves. One of the pieces is blank which means an adjacent tile can move into its place. After repeating this a few times, these puzzles can be tricky to solve.
