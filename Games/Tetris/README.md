-As you start the game, the tetriminos will start to cascade down from the top of the grid and collect at the base. To win, you'll need to rotate the Tetriminos so they fit together perfectly and form rows that span the entire playing field. With each clear, the line disappears from the grid, and you gain 10 points. Once the Tetriminos have climbed to the top of the grid, the game is over.
