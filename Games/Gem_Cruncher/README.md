## **Description 📃**
 Tile-matching puzzle game where players swap adjacent candies on a grid to form vertical or horizontal lines of three or more candies of the same color, which are then cleared from the grid, causing new candies to cascade down to fill the empty space.

## **functionalities 🎮**
The player aims to swap adjacent Gems to create matches of three or more Gems of the same type. 
When three or more Gems of the same type are aligned, they disappear from the board.
New Gem fall from the top to fill the empty spaces, potentially creating new matches (a chain reaction).
