Welcome to the Pacman Game! This classic arcade game puts you in control of Pacman, a hungry yellow character, as he navigates through a maze filled with dots, power pellets, and ghosts. Your goal is to eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts. Can you achieve the highest score and become the ultimate Pacman champion?

## **functionalities üéÆ**

1. Start Screen: The game displays a start screen with the game's title, instructions, and options to start the game or adjust settings.

2. Maze Generation: The game generates a random maze consisting of walls and corridors for Pacman to navigate.

3. Pacman Movement: Pacman can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The player controls Pacman's movement using the arrow keys or alternative keys on the keyboard.

4. Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between Pacman and various objects in the maze, such as dots, power pellets, ghosts, and walls. It determines the outcome of these collisions, such as increasing the score, causing Pacman to lose a life, or allowing Pacman to eat ghosts when they are vulnerable.

5. Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score as they collect dots, eat ghosts, or consume fruit. The score is updated and displayed on the screen during gameplay.

6. Lives Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's remaining lives. When Pacman is caught by a ghost without the protection of a power pellet, the player loses a life. The number of remaining lives is displayed on the screen.

7. Ghost AI: The game implements artificial intelligence for the ghosts, allowing them to chase Pacman, avoid obstacles, and change their behavior when Pacman consumes a power pellet.

8. Power Pellet Effects: When Pacman eats a power pellet, the ghosts temporarily become vulnerable, allowing Pacman to eat them for bonus points. The game handles the effects and duration of power pellets.

9. Game Over: When the player loses all their lives or completes all levels, the game displays a game over screen showing the final score and providing options to play again or exit the game.

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**

1. Start the Game: Launch the Pacman game on your chosen platform or device. You will typically see a start screen with the game's title and options.

2. Understand the Objective: The goal of Pacman is to navigate through a maze filled with dots while avoiding ghosts. Your objective is to eat all the dots to complete the level and earn points.

3. Control Pacman's Movement: You can control Pacman's movement using either the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or alternative keys such as 'W' for up, 'A' for left, 'S' for down, and 'D' for right. Use these controls to guide Pacman through the maze.

4. Navigate the Maze: As Pacman moves, he will automatically eat any dots he comes across, increasing your score. Use the controls to navigate through the maze's corridors, avoiding walls and obstacles.

5. Avoid Ghosts: The maze is also inhabited by ghosts. If a ghost touches Pacman without the protection of a power pellet, you lose a life. Avoid the ghosts and plan your movements strategically to stay away from them.

6. Eat Power Pellets: Scattered throughout the maze are larger dots called power pellets. When Pacman eats a power pellet, the ghosts turn blue and become vulnerable. Take advantage of this opportunity to eat the blue ghosts for extra points. Be aware that the power pellet effect is temporary, and the ghosts will eventually recover.

7. Score Points: Eating dots, power pellets, and vulnerable ghosts all contribute to your score. Strive to achieve the highest score possible as you progress through the levels.

8. Game Over: The game continues until you lose all your lives by colliding with ghosts without the protection of a power pellet. When the game ends, you will see a game over screen displaying your final score and offering options to play again or exit the game.
