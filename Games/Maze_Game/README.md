## **Description üìÉ** 
- This game is a user-friendly and interactive game designed to engage users. The primary objective of the game is to guide "Jerry" (the movable character) from one end of the maze to the other end where "Cheese" is located. Players need to strategize and find the correct path through the maze, avoiding dead ends and obstacles along the way. The game logic includes collision detection to ensure that "Jerry" does not pass through walls or obstacles. If "Jerry" encounters a wall or obstacle, the movement is restricted in that direction. When "Jerry" successfully reaches the "Cheese" at the end of the maze, the game concludes, displaying a victory message.
