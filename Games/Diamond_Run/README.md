# Diamond_Run

"Here we are. Main security is disabled, the doors are on local. Only four stories between you and the diamond. Remember, you only have one hour."
"The diamond is here ! But you have a feeling that something isn't right .. maybe you forgot to disable some hidden sensors and all hell will break loose once you grab it.",
"Oops .. you half expected a wailing siren, but instead the building went dark. The elevators seem to be out as well, you will need another way down.",
"You escape the tower empty handed, trying to recover your breath from the stress. Looking at the building again, you swear to come back better prepared. After all, there still is some time left.",
"You lost count of time ... the main security system reactivates, bolting all doors shut and trapping you inside. GAME OVER.",
"You close the entrance door and prompty vanish into the darkness. Slowly, you start to realize that you made it, the diamond is
yours. A new life begins. YOU WIN."
