# **Guess Who - Gamer Edition**

<br>

## **Description 📃**

Welcome to Guess Who? Gaming Edition! Just like the real life board-game, your job is to find out which gaming character we are thinking of!


## **functionalities 🎮**

You will be given a set of questions that you can ask on the control panel. Just click on the "?" button  next to your desired question, and we will give you the answer.
You may ask as many questions as you would like, but the least you ask, the better your score!
 Just like in the board-game, you can eliminate characters from the board! Just go to the desired character, and double-click on his/her card. 
 If you wish to add the desired character back, just double-click again  on the respective card.
<br>

## **How to play? 🕹️**

You can make a guess at any point of the game! Just click on the "Guess Who?" button on the  right panel, and click on your desired character.
If you would like to keep asking questions and not make the guess, you can simply click on the "Cancel" button on the right panel.
BUT THERE IS A CATCH! You only have 3 chances to guess. If you fail 3 times, you lose the game!
