## Description:-
- The computer will have a unique 4-digit number while the player tries to guess it.
- The number to be guessed must be a 4 digit number, using unique digits only from 0 - 9(0 should not be the first digit) 
- e.g. 1874 is valid, 0172 is not valid, 9877 is not valid, 9536 is valid.

### For every guess that the player makes, he gets 2 values - the number of bulls and the number of cows.
- 1 bull means the guess and the target number have 1 digit in common, and in the correct position.
- 1 cow means the guess and the target number have 1 digit in common, but not in correct position.
Eg. Let the target be 1234. Guessing 4321 will give 0 bulls and 4 cows. 3241 will give 1 bull and 3 cows. 4 bulls means you have won the game!
