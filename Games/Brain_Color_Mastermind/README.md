## Objective: 
Focus on the color and match and get the feedback.

- The code is a four color code containing the colored buttons displayed. 
- The code may contain multiples of the same color. 
- Try to guess the correct code (color and order) by clicking on the colored buttons and then hitting the submit button. 
- Your guess will then be compared to the code.
- For every correct color that is in the correct position, a black peg will  be displayed.
