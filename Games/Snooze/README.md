## **How to play? 🕹️**
- Instructions:
	- You play as an alarm clock on wheels. You keep moving forward at all times. 
	- Zoom around the apartment and collect musical notes which wake the human up. 
	- Avoid the human’s hands which try to press the snooze button — a single press will end the round. 
	- For some reason the hands are inexplicably big and even-more-inexplicably not attached to a body, and yet-even-more-inexplicably they fall out of the sky, but don’t worry too much about it.
- Controls:
	- Desktop: Arrows to turn left, right, and jump (up). Use the down arrow to tilt the camera a bit.
	- Mobile: Tap and hold to turn left and right. Tap and release to jump.
