## **File naming conventions üìÅ**
- Give unique name for your game that don't exist already. 
* Folder naming convention
    - ```Game_Name```  ex.  ```Tilting_Maze```,```Rock_Paper_Scissors``` (first letter should be capital and if you need space use underscore **_** )      
* files in the folder 
    - Main html file should be named as **index.html** , not something else like ```Tilting_Maze.html```(Preferred)
    - Game files - ```index.html``` , ```script.js``` , ```style.css```(not stictly to follow this but you should have separate file for each kind)
    - It is preferred if the main html file is directly added to the main folder of you game like ```Tilting_Maze/index.html``` along with other files like **style.css**, **script.js**
    - you can have other folders if you are having assets for your game 
    - Create```README.md``` for your Game using this [TEMPLATE](../Games/FOLDER_README_TEMPLATE.md).Although, it is not compulsory to follow this README template ,you can use your own *README* template whichever you prefer, to explain functionality and code of your Game
* naming convention for the screenshot you will add in ```assets/images```
    - Remember preview image should be in ```assets/images``` and not in main folder of Game itself.
    - Name of image should be same as your Game name
    - ex. ```Tilting_Maze.jpeg``` or .jpg or .png any of the image format, but don't add image format in the name itself , it is self-assigned to a image, you don't need to add it manually, otherwise it becomes ```Tilting_Maze.jpeg.jpeg```
    - There should be only one ScreenShot of the game in ```assets/images``` and that too with same name as the Game (Exactly Same).
* Note:-All Other data except the ScreenShot of your Game, should be in it's main folder , don't add it to other folders of the project.

## Add Game to `assets/js/gamesData.json`

*This guide will help you add your game to the main website.*

1. **Locate `gamesData.json`:** Go to the end of the `gamesData.json` file.

2. **Add Your Game Data:** Append the following JSON entry at the end of the file:
   ```json
   ,
   "No.": {
       "gameTitle": "Title",
       "gameUrl": "Main Folder",
       "thumbnailUrl": "Preview Image"
   }
   ```

   - **No.:** Replace `No.` with the next number in sequence. For example, if the last number in the file is `625`, use `626` for your game.

   - **Title:** Replace `"Title"` with the title of your game as it should appear on the website. For example, if your game is named `Super_Mario_Game`, use `"Super Mario Game"`.

   - **Main Folder:** Replace `"Main Folder"` with the path to your game's main HTML file. If `index.html` is directly in the game's folder, use the folder name (e.g., `"Super_Mario_Game"`). If `index.html` is in a subfolder, specify the path (e.g., `"Super_Mario_Game/public"`). If your main HTML file is not named `index.html`, include the file name (e.g., `"Super_Mario_Game/mario.html"` or `"Super_Mario_Game/public/mario.html"`).

   - **Preview Image:** Replace `"Preview Image"` with the name of the image you added to the `assets/images` folder, including the file format. For example, `"Super_Mario_Game.png"` or `"Super_Mario_Game.jpg"`.

3. **Important Notes:**
   - **Comma Placement:** Ensure you add a comma before your new entry. This is crucial to maintain valid JSON format. The provided sample includes the comma, but make sure you don‚Äôt forget it.
   - **Trailing Comma:** JSON does not allow trailing commas. Do not add a comma after the last entry. Ensure your new game entry is added before the final closing curly brace of the file.
   - **File Integrity:** Do not modify any other part of the file. Only add your game entry at the end.

4. **Check if Game Load**
   - **Open index.html:** After you have added your game to the gamesData.json open index.html of GameZone
   - **Go To last Page:** Go to the Last page and check if your game is loading along with preview image and when opened ,works properly.
